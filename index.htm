            I am a Student in Management Information Systems at the University of Nebraska

            at Omaha  Nebraska. I am from Hyderabad, India. This is my first semester here in UNO.

            I have completed my bachelors in mechanical engineering and got selected for
 
           Tech Mahindra as an associate software engineer during my campus placements and

            later moved to Protowind IT services and worked as a technical consultant for ERP

            (Enterprise resource planning ) implementation for a couple of organizations.

            I like to travel and had the opportunity of visiting a couple of countries before coming

            to the United States and during my leisure time I like to read about different 

            countries and I like watching sports.
